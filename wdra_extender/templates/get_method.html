<p>
There are currently two extract methods, Search and ID.<br><br>
Search has two forms the basic and advanced. The basic form offers include and exclude terms as well as total
number of tweets to return. The basic form will return the tweet ID and the tweet text as is the default for the APIv2,
it is also limited to the last 7 days.<br>
The advanced form has include and exclude terms, and total number of tweets to return with batch size control. The
advanced form allows selection of date and time range and/or selection of tweet ID range (within the limitation of
your API credentials, non-academic users are still limited to the last 7 days). The advanced form allows selection of
the return information giving access to the full suit of API return fields.
<br><br>
ID is a tweet hydrating feature, by supplying a list of tweet IDs the API is used to obtain all available fields from
the tweet.
